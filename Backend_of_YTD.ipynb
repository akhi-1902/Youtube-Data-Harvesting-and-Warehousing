            "Video Description: Rahul Gandhi's prediction of the Congress party securing 150 seats in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly elections is met with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's confident rebuttal, stating that the BJP is poised to win over 200 seats. A significant discussion on election preparedness takes place among prominent Congress leaders during a meeting with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge. With the recent triumph in Karnataka, where the Congress reclaimed power from the BJP, the focus now shifts to Madhya Pradesh, which is set to hold elections later this year. It is noteworthy that the Congress previously held the government in MP in 2018 but later lost power to the BJP due to defections led by Jyotiraditya Scindia.\n",
